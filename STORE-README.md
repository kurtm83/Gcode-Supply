/store/
  products.json             - Product database

/images/store/              - Product images (create this folder)
```

## Adding Products - Step by Step

1. **Prepare Product:**
   - Create or obtain STL file
   - Take/find product image (recommended: 800x800px)
   - Upload image to `/images/store/your-product.jpg`
   - Calculate pricing (cost + markup)

2. **Add in Admin:**
   - Login to admin dashboard
   - Click "Add Product"
   - Fill all fields
   - Set "In Stock" if ready to sell
   - Mark "Featured" for homepage display

3. **Save and Download:**
   - After saving, click "Download products.json"
   - Replace `/store/products.json` with downloaded file
   - Refresh store page to see changes

## Pricing Strategy

### Craftcloud3D Phase:
1. Upload STL to Craftcloud3D
2. Get manufacturing quote (e.g., $8)
3. Add your markup (e.g., 2.5x = $20)
4. Set product price at $20
5. Profit: $12 per sale

### Formula:
```
Retail Price = (Manufacturing Cost × Markup) + Shipping Buffer
Example: ($8 × 2.5) + $0 = $20
```

## Upgrading Fulfillment

### When to Upgrade to Shapeways:
- Processing 50+ orders/month manually is tedious
- Want semi-automation
- Willing to pay 5% for convenience

### When to Upgrade to Slant3D:
- Processing 500+ orders/month
- Need full automation
- Want print-on-demand integration

### Migration Steps:
1. Login to admin dashboard
2. Go to Settings
3. Enter API key for new provider
4. Select new provider as active
5. Test with one order
6. Switch all products over

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Security Considerations:**

1. **Change Default Password Immediately**
2. **Admin URL:** The URL `/secretstorebackdoor.html` is "security through obscurity" - not true security
3. **For Production:** Implement proper authentication:
   - Backend server with user sessions
   - Database for products (not JSON file)
   - Proper password hashing
   - HTTPS/SSL certificate

## Future Enhancements

This MVP can be enhanced with:
- Real authentication system
- Database backend (Firebase, MongoDB, etc.)
- Payment processing (Stripe, PayPal)
- Order tracking dashboard
- Automated email notifications
- Customer accounts
- Inventory management
- Analytics dashboard

## Troubleshooting

**Products not showing:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `products.json` is valid JSON
- Ensure file paths are correct

**Can't login to admin:**
- Check password in `products.json`
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console

**Images not loading:**

- Ensure correct file extensions

## Support

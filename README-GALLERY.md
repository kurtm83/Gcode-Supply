# GCode Supply Website - Gallery Management

## Quick Start

To update your website content, edit the configuration files and run the update script.

### Update Script

```bash
node scripts/update-gallery.js
```

This single command updates:
- Featured "Recent Work" section
- Gallery video grid
- Services page video playlist

## Configuration Files

### 1. featured-project.txt

Controls the featured project in the "Recent Work" section.

**Edit this to showcase a new project:**

```

**Steps to update:**
1. Add your project images to the `images/` folder
2. Edit `featured-project.txt` with your project details
3. Run `node scripts/update-gallery.js`

### 2. youtube-videos.txt

Lists all videos to display in the gallery grid (maintains order).

**Format:**
```
https://youtu.be/tR23ThTc6WM
https://youtu.be/KS9b1L6CTFg
https://youtu.be/4UT1HEY-qXY
```

Add or remove YouTube URLs, one per line. The order here is preserved in the gallery.

## Services Page

The services page automatically cycles through all videos from `youtube-videos.txt` in a **randomized order** that:
- Changes every 24 hours for each visitor
- Can be refreshed with a hard reload (Ctrl+F5)
- Persists across normal page refreshes

## Notes

- Lines starting with `#` are comments (ignored)
- YouTube URLs can be in any format (youtu.be, youtube.com/watch, etc.)
- Images should be placed in the `images/` folder
- The script automatically updates both gallery.html and services.html
